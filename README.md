# BaseballInningTracker
Let's you keep track of baseball inning numbers and scores for home and visiting teams. Code will save scores if you wish to exit and return to it later.

The BaseballInningTracker is a basic project to help people document baseball scores.

If this is your first time using this program, hit 1 to create a new game and enter your team names.

Hit 2 to enter the inning number (will only let you enter the current inning)

Hit 3 to view scores for each inning and totals after each inning

Hit 4 to exit

Keep in mind this program only goes up to 9 innings.
